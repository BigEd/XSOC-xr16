Dear intrepid student, educator, hobbyist, or researcher,

Thank you for your interest in the XSOC Project.  The XSOC Project
is an unsupported collection of experimental hardware and software
designs and specifications, cited in the Circuit Cellar magazine
series, "Building a RISC System in an FPGA", and providing an
example for the noble purpose of teaching computer design.

XSOC consists of the XSOC System-on-a-Chip design, including the
xr16 RISC processor core, and an on-chip bus and peripherals.
It is accompanied by a port of the lcc4.1 retargetable C compiler
that targets xr16, and a simple xr16 assembler and simulator.

Please be sure to carefully review the XSOC License Agreement
(see the LICENSE file).

Also be sure to visit http://www.fpgacpu.org/xsoc for the latest news
and to check that you have the current version of the XSOC Project.
This is version Beta 0.93.

To begin, read the Getting Started Guide (doc\started.pdf).

If you do try the XSOC Project, please let us know what you think
of it, either by sending a message to fpga-cpu@egroups.com or
by filling out the Survey and sending it to xsoc-survey@fpgacpu.org.

I do hope you enjoy working with the XSOC Project and that it inspires
you to pursue further hands-on study of computer design and FPGAs.

Jan Gray
President, Gray Research LLC
