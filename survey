Please help us improve the XSOC Project, by taking a few minutes to
answer as many of the following questions as you wish, and then
emailing your responses to xsoc-survey@fpgacpu.org.

Aggregated numeric answers and select written answers may be posted to
fpga-cpu@egroups.com, so please don't send anything sensitive.

If you are currently having problems, please do not use this survey to

Please rate your XSOC experiences on a scale of 0-5:

   [0] - not applicable, not yet
   [1] - no, hard, didn't work, got stuck, confusing, frustrating
   [2] -
   [3] - perhaps, OK, acceptable, could be better
   [4]
   [5] - yes, easy, successful, works great, clear, pleasant
   [ ] - ignored question
   [@] - written answer, for example, [instructor]

   Please answer yes/no questions with either a [1] or a [5].
