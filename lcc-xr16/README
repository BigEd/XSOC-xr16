The C compiler for the XSOC Project is lcc-xr16, a port of lcc4.1 that
targets xr16.

Lcc4.1 is the retargetable C compiler written by Christopher W. Fraser
and David R. Hanson, and described in their book

    A Regargetable C Compiler: Design and Implementation,
    Benjamin/Cummings, Redwood City, CA, 1995.

Lcc is available free of charge, see
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc.

The XSOC License Agreement does not apply to the original lcc4.1
distribution.  The lcc distribution bears its own copyright and license,
a copy of which is provided in the file CPYRIGHT.

The XSOC License Agreement does apply to the lcc-xr16 changes made to
the lcc4.1, described below.

See the XSOC Project Getting Started Guide for instructions on how to
install lcc-xr16, and for instructions on how to report problems.

Please report lcc-xr16 problems to us, not to the lcc4.1 authors.
See issues\issues-howto for directions on reporting issues.

The directory src-mods contains four files derived from the lcc4.1
distribution:

1.  makefile.xr16, derived from lcc4.1's makefile.nt (added rules for
    the targets lcc-xr16.exe and rcc-xr16.exe, and for the XR16 machine
    description xr16.md).

2.  src\bind.c, derived from lcc4.1's src\bind.c (added the xr16
    target interface);

3.  src\xr16.md, derived from lcc4.1's src\mips.md;

4.  etc\xr16-win32.c, derived from lcc4.1's etc\win32.c.

It also contains a new directory, libxr16, providing a minimal
xr16 runtime library.
